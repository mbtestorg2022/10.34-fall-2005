description: This resource provides information about a  procedure that takes a square
  dimension   matrix that discretizes a transport term in a PDE on a given computational
  domain, and the number of the field to which it is to be applied, and returns the
  square dimension DOF (where DOF = num of fields*num of pts) matrix containing these
  elements in the proper position for the selected field.
